{"name":"Collab-Todo","tagline":"A todo application written using the Grails web framework that allows users to create and manage todos, create buddy lists, and assign todos to others.","body":"Collab-Todo Web Application\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nThis application is a to-do application written in the Grails framework. It allows users to create and manage todos in categories. Users are also able to create buddy lists of other users of the application and can easily assign tasks to other users. It will also include reports and batch emails, along with some other functionality.\r\n\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Java Development Kit\r\n- Groovy 2.1.3\r\n- Grails 2.2.2\r\n\r\nRunning the Application\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nDownload the repository as a ZIP archive and extract it or clone the repository, then run the following from the command line:\r\n```\r\ngrails run-app\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may also need to run a <code>grails upgrade</code> if you are using a newer version of Grails.\r\n\r\nAfter running the application, navigate to http://localhost:8080/collab-todo in your browser.\r\n\r\nUsing the Application\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nAfter running the application the application, you will be greeted with the welcome screen.\r\n\r\n![alt text][screenshot1]\r\n\r\nYou may then proceed to login using the username: <code>casey</code> and the password: <code>password</code>. After logging in, you can look at, update, delete, or add new Categories, Users, or Todos. Sample data is created when the application is run to give an example of how the application works. More implementations are currently being worked on.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites to Adding New Data\r\n\r\n#### Adding Todos\r\n\r\nTo be able to add Todos, you must already have at least one User and one Category, since Todos have a many-to-one relationship with both Categories and Users. If you do not already have these created you won't be able to create a new Todo.\r\n\r\n#### Adding Categories\r\n\r\nTo add a category, you must already have at least one user, because Categories have a many-to-one relationship with Users.\r\n\r\n#### Adding Users\r\n\r\nThere are no prerequisites to adding users.\r\n\r\n#### Credits\r\n\r\nThis application is loosely based off of the application in the book Beginning Groovy, Grails and Griffon by Vishal Layka.\r\n\r\n[screenshot1]: https://github.com/caseyscarborough/collab-todo/raw/master/img/main.png \"The application's main layout.\"","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
